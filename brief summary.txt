20,000 X-ray images

Body parts : Elbow, Hand, and Shoulder

72% training, 18% validation and 10% test
Each generator to process and convert the filepaths into image arrays, and the labels into one-hot encoded labels.
The resulting generators can then be used to train and evaluate a deep learning model.

Starts with data augmentation and pre-processing the x-ray images - flip horizontal

We use rgb 3 channels and 224x224 pixels images, use feature extracting , and average pooling

ResNet50 neural network to classify the type of bone
ResNet-50 is a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the neural network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.
